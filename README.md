# Design Patterns

This is a collection of known design patterns and some sample code how to implement them in C#.


## Creational
* [AbstractFactory](https://github.com/aymansayedmohamed/DesignPatterns/tree/master/AbstractFactory) :
: The abstract factory pattern provides a way to encapsulate a group of individual factories 
     that have a common theme without specifying their concrete classes.
* [Factory](https://github.com/aymansayedmohamed/DesignPatterns/tree/master/Factory)
 : the factory method pattern is a creational pattern that uses factory methods to deal with 
     the problem of creating objects without having to specify the exact class of the object that will be created. 


## Behavioral

* [Command](https://github.com/aymansayedmohamed/DesignPatterns/tree/master/Command)
: the command pattern is a behavioral design pattern in which an object is used to
    encapsulate all information needed to perform an action or trigger an event at a later time. 
    like commands at photoshop (do & undo)
* [Strategy](https://github.com/aymansayedmohamed/DesignPatterns/tree/master/Strategy)
: the strategy pattern is a behavioral software design pattern that enables selecting an algorithm at runtime. Instead of implementing a single algorithm directly, code receives run-time instructions as to which in a family of algorithms to use.

* [TemplateMethod](https://github.com/aymansayedmohamed/DesignPatterns/tree/master/TemplateMethod)
: Template method pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines the program skeleton of an algorithm in an operation,deferring some steps to subclasses.
